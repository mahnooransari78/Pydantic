#  Pydantic Example Project

This project demonstrates the basic usage of **Pydantic**, a Python library for **data validation and settings management** using Python type annotations.

---

##  What is Pydantic?

**Pydantic** is a Python library that uses **type hints** to:
- Parse and validate data at runtime
- Ensure input data is correct
- Automatically convert data types if needed
- Provide meaningful error messages when validation fails

It is widely used in **FastAPI**, **data pipelines**, and projects that require **structured data validation**.

---

##  Features

- Runtime data validation using Python type hints
- Automatic type conversion (e.g., `"123"` â†’ `123`)
- Built-in validators (like `EmailStr`, `HttpUrl`, etc.)
- Nested model support
- Integration-friendly (works well with FastAPI, etc.)"# Pydantic" 

#  Why Pydantic for DACA?

Pydantic is a powerful Python library used in **DACA** (Data Acquisition, Cleaning, and Analysis) to ensure **clean, valid, and structured data**.
